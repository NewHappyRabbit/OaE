Whats missing:
- Maybe add "Requires" in unit upgrades, etc.?
- Check this tool: https://www.hiveworkshop.com/asset-scanner - to find the custom icons used in the map
- Check this tool to find the borders textures and get them in the site: https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/ladiks-casc-viewer.331540/ , https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/warcraft-iii-borders.226648/

!URGENT!
- Wrap all tables in another div with class tableWrapper and do css: overflow-x: auto, like this:
<div class="tableWrapper" style="overflow-x: auto" (but as CSS not inline)>
 <table>...</table>
</div>

Elves
- Units
-- All units
---desc, tips

-- Ancient

-- Elven Worker
--- Abilities (from spell book)
--- Add upgrades from "tree of life"

-- Owl Scout
--- reforged icon is different i think

-- Hippogryph
--- Add "Passive" to Deep Wounds ability (like Owl Scout - Night Vision)
--- Add "... has upgrades from Tree of Technology" text

- Buildings
-- Gold mine
--- Change description "feed" text to "This structure feeds gold only when killed after the 10 minute mar"

-- Blocker
--- Change the description to be more universal, because now it just states its health and etc. Make it something like: "The blocker is a defensive structure, used to block paths, etc."

-- Tree of Technology
--- Better descriptions for all upgrades
--- Tenacity : someone in discord says it increases the dmg of blizzard (druid)

-- Tree of Life
--- Add all ugrades and info (already have it in object)
-- Magic tower, and other towers
